# Orthomosaic Crop Row Detector

The Orthomosaic Crop Row Detector can be used to detect crop rows in orthomosaics. It uses the original orthomosaic and a gray-scale orthomosaic of the crops locations to determine crops rows. The orthomosaic is divided into tiles and crop rows within a tile is assumed to have the same orientation.
